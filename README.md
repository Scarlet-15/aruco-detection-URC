# aruco-detection-URC
The aim is to detect the aruco markers in the frame of the video feed and to find the distance of these markers from the camera thus we can make the rover keep track of it's distance from the marker.
Also we want to find the distance between 2 aruco markers if more than one of them is found thus, if the distance between them is 2 meters the rover confirms that it represents a gate and if not then we confirm that marker represents a post.
